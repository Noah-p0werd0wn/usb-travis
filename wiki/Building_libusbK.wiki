= How to build libusbK from source =
=== Requirements: ===
  * WDK 6001.18002 or higher. (driver, DLLs, EXEs)
  * Visual Studio 2008/Express or higher (DLLs and EXEs only)
=== Optional Requirements: ===
  * Astyle (http://astyle.sourceforge.net) Astyle is used by the "_make.cmd formatcode_" command.<br/> Astyle ensures all code is uniformly formatted and all line endings or in proper crlf (windows) order.
  * 7Zip (http://www.7-zip.org) 7z.exe is used by the "_make.cmd zip=src*/*bin*/*all_" command.<br/> make.cmd uses the clean regular expression defined in make.cfg to determine which files to place in the .zip packages.
=== Building with WDK: ===
Users already familiar with WDK can buld libusbK in the same way WDK samples are built:
  * Open your desired DDK environment
  * Changed to the project directory you wish to build (or the root to build all)
  * Type "_build /cegZ_"
=== Building with Visual Studios: ===
todo
=== make.cmd: ===
make.cmd is a build and packaging automation batch file for WDK.  The script itself is non-specific to libusbK so it can be used for any WDK project. 
  * make.cmd is configured through an ini-like .cfg file.
  * Most options set in make.cfg can be overridden by passing them on the command line.
  * All param=value pairs defined in make.cfg or passed on the command line are SET in dos environment space; available for the duration of the build.
