#labels Phase-Build,Featured

= Introduction =
libusbwK is built with WDK and/or Visual Studios 2008 (or greater).  The driver can only be built with WDK.

=== WDK Users ===
Users already familiar with WDK can buld libusbwK in the same way WDK samples are built:
  * Open your desired DDK environment
  * Changed to the project directory you wish to build (or the root to build all)
  * Type "_build /cegZ_"

=== Requirements ===
  * WDK 6001.18002 or higher. (driver, dll, lib)
  * Visual Studio 2008/Express or higher (dll and lib only)

=== Optional Requirements ===
  * Astyle (http://astyle.sourceforge.net) Astyle is used by the "_make.cmd formatcode_" command.<br/> Astyle ensures all code is uniformly formatted and all line endings or in proper crlf (windows) order.
  * 7Zip (http://www.7-zip.org) 7z.exe is used by the "_make.cmd zip=[[src/bin/all]]_"<br/>Make.cmd uses the clean regular expression defined in make.cfg to determine which files to place in the .zip packages.
